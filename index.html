                <h3>üìñ Meet the Talking Vowels: A Storytime Moment</h3>
                <p>Once upon a time, vowels lived single as they were afraid of relationships {A, E, I, O , U } their life inspired some two sneaky consonants 
                    {y and w}. the five super vowels   realized that Eeee! being alone was kinda boring‚Ä¶ so they started the search for partners through teaming up! Some pairs decided that one vowel should do all the talking(king vowel) (ai, oa, ee), while others blended their voices together (oi, ou, ow). And guess what? Some vowel teams even like to switch sounds depending on the word! Sneaky, right? (Just like when your students try to sneak extra break time! üòâ)</p>
