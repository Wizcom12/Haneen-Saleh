                <p>Once upon a time, vowels realized that being alone was kinda boring‚Ä¶ so they teamed up! Some pairs decided that one vowel should do all the talking(king vowel) (ai, oa, ee), while others blended their voices together (oi, ou, ow). And guess what? Some vowel teams even like to switch sounds depending on the word! Sneaky, right? (Just like when your students try to sneak extra break time! üòâ)</p>
